Login PHP procedural mySQLi project



Php is a the language that made me realize that i need to get back into object oriented languages, and how much i like them. Php is just really simplistic. Pages are streamlined with easy include and include_once. Which of course opens the door to stream line all my own web projects.  All the tricks from moving redundant parts to a different file and including them to others excites me. Notes for various sections are also included in the code. A solid tutorial.  

Things I need to look into: die(); , (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/", $username) , !filter_var.

SQL is the newest language added to my skill set. I understand the language usages and implications but definitely need to learn more about the various functions, and communication with xampp.
