Login PHP procedural mySQLi project

This tutorial was really intersting to learn. All the tricks from moving redundant parts to a different file and including them to others was a thing i really want to implement in my own site. It was a solid tutorial.  CSS files were provided by the tutorial and some php files are blank but were created at the time because of following the tutorial.
